Design a “Laboratory Notes” mobile screen for a professional chemistry AI application.

IMPORTANT:
- Continue the existing design system shown in the app (same typography, spacing, colors, card style, rounded corners).
- Do NOT redesign the whole app.
- This screen must feel like a natura extension of the current UI.

STYLE:
- Clean, clinical, modern
- White background
- Soft shadows
- Rounded cards
- Blue as primary accent (same blue as existing app)
- Subtle icons, no dark mode

HEADER:
- Title: "Laboratory Notes"
- Subtitle (small, muted): "Experiment observations & insights"
- Right side: Filter icon (by date / experiment)
- Left side: Back arrow

EXPERIMENT SELECTOR:
- Horizontal dropdown card
- Label: "Selected Experiment"
- Example value: "Acetylsalicylic Acid Synthesis"
- Small tag showing date
- Chevron icon

TIMELINE SECTION:
- Vertical timeline layout
- Each entry aligned to the left with a circular step indicator

NOTE CARD (reusable component):
- Rounded white card
- Timestamp at top right (e.g. "14:32")
- Step reference in small text (e.g. "Step 2 – Solvent Addition")
- Main note text (2–3 lines max)
- Optional elements inside the card:
- Small photo thumbnail
- Voice note icon
- Status tag at bottom:
- Yellow: "Unexpected Reaction"
- Red: "Issue"
- Green: "Successful Insight"
- Light divider lines

EMPTY STATE (if no notes yet):
- Minimal illustration (lab notebook icon)
- Text: "No lab notes yet"
- Subtext: "Start your experiment to add observations"

BOTTOM ACTION BAR:
- Sticky bottom bar
- Primary button (blue): "Add Note"
- Secondary icon buttons:
- Camera
- Microphone
- Text note

FLOATING AI ACTION BUTTON:
- Circular floating button
- Label: "Analyze Notes"
- AI spark icon
- Positioned bottom-right above navigation bar

INTERACTIONS:
- Tapping a note expands it
- Long press shows options: Edit, Tag, Add media
- Smooth transitions, no flashy animations

OVERALL GOAL:
This screen should feel like a professional laboratory logbook enhanced by AI, designed for chemists working in real lab
environments.
